  <H2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</H2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a>is the stamdard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web aqqlications.
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p><p>

An HTML document is an SGML document that meets the constraints of this specification.
Author
An author is a person or program that writes or generates HTML documents. An authoring tool is a special case of an author, namely, it's a program that generates HTML.
We recommend that authors write documents that conform to the strict DTD rather than the other DTDs defined by this specification. Please see the section on version information for details about the DTDs defined in HTML 4.

User
A user is a person who interacts with a user agent to view, hear, or otherwise use a rendered HTML document.
HTML user agent
An HTML user agent is any device that interprets HTML documents. User agents include visual browsers (text-only and graphical), non-visual browsers (audio, Braille), search robots, proxies, etc.
A conforming user agent for HTML 4 is one that observes the mandatory conditions ("must") set forth in this specification, including the following points:

A user agent should avoid imposing arbitrary length limits on attribute value literals (see the section on capacities in the SGML Declaration). For introductory information on SGML attributes, please consult the section on attribute definitions.
A user agent must ensure that rendering is unchanged by the presence or absence of start tags and end tags when the HTML DTD indicates that these are optional. See the section on element definitions for introductory information on SGML elements.
For reasons of backwards compatibility, we recommend that tools interpreting HTML 4 continue to support HTML 3.2 (see [HTML32]) and HTML 2.0 (see [RFC1866]).</p>
